# Hotel-Room-Reservation-System
The Hotel Room Reservation System, developed using PHP,HTML+CSS, SQL and JavaScript, allows users to conveniently book, modify, or cancel room reservations at Alpha Royal Hotel via the Internet.

## Softwares used -

**PHP:** PHP is a server-side scripting language that handles the dynamic aspects of the system. It's responsible for processing user requests, interacting with the database, and generating dynamic content to be displayed in the web browser. In the context of this reservation system, PHP manages tasks like validating user input, checking room availability, and processing reservation transactions.

**HTML+CSS:** HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used for structuring the content of web pages, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for designing and styling the appearance of these pages. In the context of the system, HTML is used to create the structure of the reservation interface, displaying elements like input fields, buttons, and labels. CSS styles the HTML elements, making the interface visually appealing and user-friendly.

**SQL:** SQL (Structured Query Language) is used for managing and querying databases. In the Hotel Room Reservation System, SQL is employed to create and manage a database that stores important information related to rooms, reservations, users, and more. This includes details like room availability, reservation dates, user credentials, and booking status.

**JavaScript:** JavaScript is a client-side scripting language that enhances the interactivity of web pages. It's used to add dynamic behavior to the user interface. In this system, JavaScript might be used to perform tasks like displaying real-time availability information, validating user input before submission, and providing instant feedback to users when they're making or modifying reservations.

## Main Functionalities -

**Booking Rooms:** Users can search for available rooms based on their preferences, such as check-in and check-out dates, room type, and number of guests. The PHP backend interacts with the SQL database to retrieve available room options, which are then presented to the user through the HTML+CSS interface.

**Modifying Reservations:** Users who have already made reservations can modify their booking details, such as changing the dates of their stay or upgrading their room type. JavaScript may be used here to facilitate the smooth updating of reservation details without requiring a full page refresh.

**Canceling Reservations:** Users can cancel their reservations if needed. The PHP backend updates the database to reflect the canceled reservation status, and the HTML+CSS interface provides a clear way for users to initiate cancellation.

By combining these technologies, the Hotel Room Reservation System offers a seamless and user-friendly experience for individuals who wish to make, adjust, or cancel room reservations at the Alpha Royal Hotel via the internet. This system provides the hotel with an efficient way to manage bookings while providing customers with the convenience of online reservation management.
